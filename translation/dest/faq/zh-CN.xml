	<string name="whyFlaggedRatingManipulationOrCheater">为什么我被标记为人为操纵分数 (伪装和欺骗) 或开外挂？</string>
	<string name="cheatDetectionMethods">Lishogi具有一套强有力的侦查方法和非常彻底的审查所有证据和作出决定的程序。 这套程序往往涉及许多仲裁人，而且可能需要很长时间。 除了标记本身外，我们将不详细了解个别案件的证据或决策过程。 这样做将使今后更容易避免被发现，并且是邀请进行毫无结果的辩论。 这个时间和精力最好花在其他重要案件上。用户可以通过电子邮件 %1$s进行上诉，但是裁决很少被推翻。</string>
	<string name="whenAmIEligibleRatinRefund">我何时有资格从作弊者自动退还积分？</string>
	<string name="ratingRefundExplanation">One minute after a player is marked, their 40 latest rated games in the last 3 days are taken. If you are their opponent in those games, you lost rating (because of a loss or a draw), and your rating was not provisional, you get a rating refund. The refund is capped based on your peak rating and your rating progress after the game.
  (For example, if your rating greatly increased after those games, you might get no refund or only a partial refund.) A refund will never exceed 150 points.</string>

	<string name="leavingGameWithoutResigningExplanation">如果你的对手经常中止/离开游戏，他们会得到“游戏禁令”，这意味着他们被暂时禁止玩游戏。 这一点在他们的简介中没有公开说明。 如果这种行为继续下去，游戏禁令的期限就会延长――长期这种行为可能会导致帐户的关闭。</string>

The use of engines is still prohibited and will result in being flagged for engine assistance. Although ICCF allows engine use in correspondence, Lishogi does not.</string>

	<string name="eightVariants">8 种国际象棋变体</string>
	<string name="whatIsACPL">平均兵厘损失 (ACPL) 是什么？</string>
	<string name="acplExplanation">兵厘是国际象棋计算优势所用的计量单位。1兵厘等于兵价值的1/100。也就是说，100兵厘=1兵。这些价值在游戏中不起正式作用，但对玩家有用，对电脑来评估局面也很重要。

最佳的电脑着法将会损失0兵厘，但较少的着法将导致兵厘计量下局面的恶化。

该值可以用作着法质量的一个指标。每次失去的兵厘越少，着法就越强。

Lishogi上的电脑分析是基于Stockfish的。</string>

	<string name="lishogiFollowFIDErules">In the event of one player running out of time, that player will usually lose the game. However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player\'s king by any possible series of legal moves (%1$s).

In rare cases this can be difficult to decide automatically (forced lines, fortresses). By default we always side with the player who did not run out of time.

Note that it can be possible to mate with a single knight or bishop if the opponent has a piece that could block the king.</string>

	<string name="discoveringEnPassant">为什么兵能够吃掉另外一只已经经过了它控制格子的兵？（吃过路兵）</string>
	<string name="explainingEnPassant">这是一个叫做“吃过路兵”的合法着法。维基百科文章给出了一个%1$s。

在3.7 (d)节中作了描述在%2$s。

“对方一只兵刚刚从初始位置起步走两格，与本方的兵处在相邻横线时，本方的兵可以吃掉它，就如同它只走了一格一样。这种吃法称为‘吃过路兵’，只能在对方兵走两格之后立即进行。“

	<string name="lishogiRatings">Lishogi ratings</string>
	<string name="whichRatingSystemUsedByLishogi">What rating system does Lishogi use?</string>
	<string name="ratingSystemUsedByLishogi">Ratings are calculated using the Glicko-2 rating method developed by Mark Glickman. This is a very popular rating method, and is used by a significant number of chess organisations (FIDE being a notable counter-example, as they still use the dated Elo rating system).

Fundamentally, Glicko ratings use \"confidence intervals\" when calculating and representing your rating. When you first start using the site, your rating starts at 1500 ± 700. The 1500 represents your rating, and the 700 represents the confidence interval.

Basically, the system is 90% sure that your rating is somewhere between 800 and 2200. It is incredibly uncertain. Because of this, when a player is just starting out, their rating will change very dramatically, potentially several hundred points at a time. But after some games against established players the confidence interval will narrow, and the amount of points gained/lost after each game will decrease.

Another point to note is that, as time passes, the confidence interval will increase. This allows you to gain/lose points points more rapidly to match any changes in your skill level over that time.</string>
	<string name="whatIsProvisionalRating">为什么在分数旁边有一个问号 (?) ？</string>
	<string name="provisionalRatingExplanation">The question mark means the rating is provisional. Reasons include:</string>
	<string name="notPlayedEnoughRatedGamesAgainstX">The player has not yet finished enough rated games against %1$s in the rating category.</string>
	<string name="similarOpponents">opponents of similar strength</string>
	<string name="notPlayedRecently">The player hasn\'t played enough recent games. Depending on the number of games you\'ve played, it might take around a year of inactivity for your rating to become provisional again.</string>
	<string name="ratingDeviationMorethanOneHundredTen">Concretely, it means that the Glicko-2 deviation is greater than 110. The deviation is the level of confidence the system has in the rating. The lower the deviation, the more stable is a rating.</string>

	<string name="beInTopTen">在此排名中获得前十。</string>
	<string name="secondRequirementToStopOldPlayersTrustingLeaderboards">第二项要求是为了让不再使用它们的帐号的棋手停止占用排行榜。</string>
	<string name="whyAreRatingHigher">Why are ratings higher compared to other sites and organisations such as FIDE, USCF and the ICC?</string>
	<string name="whyAreRatingHigherExplanation">It is best not to think of ratings as absolute numbers, or compare them against other organisations. Different organisations have different levels of players, different rating systems (Elo, Glicko, Glicko-2, or a modified version of the aforementioned). These factors can drastically affect the absolute numbers (ratings).

It\'s best to think of ratings as \"relative\" figures (as opposed to \"absolute\" figures): Within a pool of players, their relative differences in ratings will help you estimate who will win/draw/lose, and how often. Saying \"I have X rating\" means nothing unless there are other players to compare that rating to.</string>
